THIS SOFTWARE.

 This program will automatically keep a copy of the Linux Kernel image and your
 initrd.img located on your EFI System Partition (ESP) on an EFI-compatible
 system. The benefits of this approach include being able to boot Linux directly
 and bypass the GRUB bootloader in many cases, which can save 4-6 seconds during
 boot on a system with a fast drive. Please note that there are no guarantees
 about boot time saved using this method.

 For maximum safety, kernelstub recommends leaving an entry for GRUB in your
 system's ESP and NVRAM configuration, as GRUB allows you to modify boot
 parameters per-boot, which loading the kernel directly cannot do. The only
 other way to do this is to use an EFI shell to manually load the kernel and
 give it parameters from the EFI Shell. You can do this by using:

 fs0:> vmlinuz-image initrd=EFI/path/to/initrd/stored/on/esp options

 kernelstub will load parameters from the /etc/default/kernelstub config file.
